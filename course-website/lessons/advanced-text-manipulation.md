Were are getting to the end game of vim.  There is still so much out there, but
for the sake of surveying, this is where we will end.  We will cover Search and
Replace, Quickfix replace, Macros, and finally registers.

### Search and Replace
The most simple form of searching and replacing is on line.  Lets re-open back
up our `vim-playground` and open up file `twitch.c`.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/gatsby-course-starter/master/course-website/lessons/exercise-3-search-and-replace.md > exercise && vim exercise
```
