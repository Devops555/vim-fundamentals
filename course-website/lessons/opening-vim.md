## Before you do
* Navigate to an empty directory (create your own).  We will be doing a bit of
  editing.

* Ensure you have no vim rc active.
  * If you are using vim, rename ~/.vimrc -> ~/.vimrc2
  * If you are using nvim, rename ~/.config/nvim/init.vim -> ~/.config/nvim/init.vim2

* We will be using curl to grab a few exercises.
